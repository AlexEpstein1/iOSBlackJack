Dare Final Project

Our final project will be a blackjack application. Players compete against the dealer in a simple game of blackjack, where they bet a number of chips and then play to either gain or lose the chips they have. This game was designed to be played in single player, where the dealer is automated to either hit or stay at specific points.
