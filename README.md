Dare Final Project

Our final project will be a poker application. Players compete against each other in Texas Hold em. Money is tracked and the necessary payments are determined at the end of the game, to be paid out over Venmo. The game is specifically designed to be played amongst friends, so friends can invite each other to group games.
